The idea is that, through practicing certain mental models, meditation techniques and breathing techniques, be more present in highly stressful environments and therefore able to generate more brain capacitiy. That means, if you are more present in a highly stressful situation, you are able to recognize more of the things that you learned and see more things that potentially threaten you. High focus may good in Sports or extremly important single tasks. In a highly dynamic environment, its more important to have a wide attention span and enough brain capacity to handle multiple threats. Obviously, as a "normal" Person that don't have to face highly stressful situations, you can use PoliZen too. You will see some changes in your behavior.

## The Log

### Short intorduction

This ist the first app i build. I build the app in Flutter. I asked a guy on TikTok, I followed if he can help me with that project. He is a senior developer and gave me mentored support. I explained the idea an he was directly "invested". That mentored support cost 60 Euro per hour. So I have costs up front. But it was every penny worth it. After 8 Sessions we build the Layout and foundation of the app. 
Between the sessions i learned dart and flutter via Udemy. In the beginning i felt totally stupid. But the more i learned the more I saw the progress and was able to connecting the dots. 

### Beginn

< 20' May: 
- I installed dart and flutter on my Mac.
